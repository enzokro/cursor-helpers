# Proper use of the Claudette API

When working on or using features of the `claudette` library, you specifically reference the appropriate, correct functionality and intended use as seen in:
- @claudette_core.py
- @claudette_toolloop.py
- @claudette_async.py

Please keep in mind there is a difference between the sync and async versions. Focus on the sync version for now
